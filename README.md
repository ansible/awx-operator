## Purpose

This operator is meant to provide a more Kubernetes-native installation method for AWX via an AWX Custom Resource Definition (CRD).

> :warning: The operator is not supported by Red Hat, and is in **alpha** status. For now, use it at your own risk!

## Usage

### Basic Install

This Kubernetes Operator is meant to be deployed in your Kubernetes cluster(s) and can manage one or more AWX instances in any namespace.

For testing purposes, the `awx-operator` can be deployed on a [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) cluster. Due to different OS and hardware environments, please refer to the official Minikube documentation for further information.

```

```

Once Minikube is deployed, check if the node(s) and `kube-apiserver` communication is working as expected.

```
$ minikube kubectl -- get nodes

```

It is not required for `kubectl` to be separately installed since it comes already wrapped inside minikube. As demonstrated above, simply prefix `minikube kubectl --` before kubectl command, i.e. `kubectl get nodes` would become `minikube kubectl -- get nodes`

Let's create an alias for easier usage:

```
$ alias kubectl="minikube kubectl --"
```

Now you need to deploy AWX Operator into your cluster. Clone this repo and `git checkout` the latest version from https://github.com/ansible/awx-operator/releases, and then run the following command:

```
$ export NAMESPACE=my-namespace
$ make deploy
cd config/manager && /home/user/awx-operator/bin/kustomize edit set image controller=quay.io/ansible/awx-operator:0.14.0
/home/user/awx-operator/bin/kustomize build config/default | kubectl apply -f -
namespace/my-namespace created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/awxbackups.awx.ansible.com created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/awxrestores.awx.ansible.com created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/awxs.awx.ansible.com created
serviceaccount/awx-operator-controller-manager created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/awx-operator-leader-election-role created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/awx-operator-manager-role created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/awx-operator-metrics-reader created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/awx-operator-proxy-role created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/awx-operator-leader-election-rolebinding created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/awx-operator-manager-rolebinding created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/awx-operator-proxy-rolebinding created
configmap/awx-operator-manager-config created
service/awx-operator-controller-manager-metrics-service created
deployment.apps/awx-operator-controller-manager created
```

Wait a bit and you should have the `awx-operator` running:

```
$ kubectl get pods -n $NAMESPACE
NAME                                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
awx-operator-controller-manager-66ccd8f997-rhd4z   2/2     Running   0          11s
```

So we don't have to keep repeating `-n $NAMESPACE`, let's set the current namespace for `kubectl`:

```
$ kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=$NAMESPACE 
```

Next, create a file named `awx-demo.yml` with the suggested content below. The `metadata.name` you provide, will be the name of the resulting AWX deployment.

**Note:** If you deploy more than one AWX instance to the same namespace, be sure to use unique names.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: awx.ansible.com/v1beta1
kind: AWX
metadata:
  name: awx-demo
spec:
  service_type: nodeport
```

Finally, use `kubectl` to create the awx instance in your cluster:

```
$ kubectl apply -f awx-demo.yml
awx.awx.ansible.com/awx-demo created
```

After a few minutes, the new AWX instance will be deployed. You can look at the operator pod logs in order to know where the installation process is at:

```
$ kubectl logs -f deployments/awx-operator-controller-manager -c awx-manager
```

After a few seconds, you should see the operator begin to create new resources:

```
$ kubectl get pods -l "app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=awx-operator"
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
awx-demo-77d96f88d5-pnhr8   4/4     Running   0          3m24s
awx-demo-postgres-0         1/1     Running   0          3m34s

$ kubectl get svc -l "app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=awx-operator"
NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
awx-demo-postgres   ClusterIP   None           <none>        5432/TCP       4m4s
awx-demo-service    NodePort    10.109.40.38   <none>        80:31006/TCP   3m56s
```

Once deployed, the AWX instance will be accessible by running:

```
$ minikube service awx-demo-service --url -n $NAMESPACE
```

By default, the admin user is `admin` and the password is available in the `<resourcename>-admin-password` secret. To retrieve the admin password, run:

```
$ kubectl get secret awx-demo-admin-password -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode
yDL2Cx5Za94g9MvBP6B73nzVLlmfgPjR
```

You just completed the most basic install of an AWX instance via this operator. Congratulations!!!

### Admin user account configuration

There are three variables that are customizable for the admin user account creation.

| Name                        | Description                                  | Default          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| admin_user                  | Name of the admin user                       | admin            |
| admin_email                 | Email of the admin user                      | test@example.com |
| admin_password_secret       | Secret that contains the admin user password | Empty string     |


> :warning: **admin_password_secret must be a Kubernetes secret and not your text clear password**.

If `admin_password_secret` is not provided, the operator will look for a secret named `<resourcename>-admin-password` for the admin password. If it is not present, the operator will generate a password and create a Secret from it named `<resourcename>-admin-password`.

To retrieve the admin password, run `kubectl get secret <resourcename>-admin-password -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode`

The secret that is expected to be passed should be formatted as follow:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <resourcename>-admin-password
  namespace: <target namespace>
stringData:
  password: mysuperlongpassword
```


### Network and TLS Configuration

#### Service Type

If the `service_type` is not specified, the `ClusterIP` service will be used for your AWX Tower service.

The `service_type` supported options are: `ClusterIP`, `LoadBalancer` and `NodePort`.

The following variables are customizable for any `service_type`

| Name                                  | Description                                   | Default                           |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| service_labels                  | Add custom labels                             | Empty string                      |

```yaml
---
spec:
  ...
  service_type: ClusterIP
  service_labels: |
    environment: testing
```

  * LoadBalancer

The following variables are customizable only when `service_type=LoadBalancer`

| Name                           | Description                              | Default       |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| loadbalancer_annotations | LoadBalancer annotations                 | Empty string  |
| loadbalancer_protocol    | Protocol to use for Loadbalancer ingress | http          |
| loadbalancer_port        | Port used for Loadbalancer ingress       | 80            |

```yaml
---
spec:
  ...
  service_type: LoadBalancer
  loadbalancer_protocol: https
  loadbalancer_port: 443
  loadbalancer_annotations: |
    environment: testing
  service_labels: |
    environment: testing
```

When setting up a Load Balancer for HTTPS you will be required to set the `loadbalancer_port` to move the port away from `80`.

The HTTPS Load Balancer also uses SSL termination at the Load Balancer level and will offload traffic to AWX over HTTP.

  * NodePort

The following variables are customizable only when `service_type=NodePort`

| Name                           | Description                              | Default       |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| nodeport_port            | Port used for NodePort       | 30080            |

```yaml
---
spec:
  ...
  service_type: NodePort
  nodeport_port: 30080
```
#### Ingress Type

By default, the AWX operator is not opinionated and won't force a specific ingress type on you. So, when the `ingress_type` is not specified, it will default to `none` and nothing ingress-wise will be created.

The `ingress_type` supported options are: `none`, `ingress` and `route`. To toggle between these options, you can add the following to your AWX CRD:

  * None

```yaml
---
spec:
  ...
  ingress_type: none
```

  * Generic Ingress Controller

The following variables are customizable when `ingress_type=ingress`. The `ingress` type creates an Ingress resource as [documented](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) which can be shared with many other Ingress Controllers as [listed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/).

| Name                       | Description                              | Default                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ingress_annotations        | Ingress annotations                      | Empty string                 |
| ingress_tls_secret         | Secret that contains the TLS information | Empty string                 |
| hostname                   | Define the FQDN                          | {{ meta.name }}.example.com  |
| ingress_path               | Define the ingress path to the service   | /                            |
| ingress_path_type          | Define the type of the path (for LBs)    | Prefix                       |

```yaml
---
spec:
  ...
  ingress_type: ingress
  hostname: awx-demo.example.com
  ingress_annotations: |
    environment: testing
```

  * Route

The following variables are customizable when `ingress_type=route`

| Name                                  | Description                                   | Default                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------|
| route_host                      | Common name the route answers for             | `<instance-name>-<namespace>-<routerCanonicalHostname>` |
| route_tls_termination_mechanism | TLS Termination mechanism (Edge, Passthrough) | Edge                                                    |
| route_tls_secret                | Secret that contains the TLS information      | Empty string                                            |

```yaml
---
spec:
  ...
  ingress_type: route
  route_host: awx-demo.example.com
  route_tls_termination_mechanism: Passthrough
  route_tls_secret: custom-route-tls-secret-name
```

### Database Configuration

#### External PostgreSQL Service

In order for the AWX instance to rely on an external database, the Custom Resource needs to know about the connection details. Those connection details should be stored as a secret and either specified as `postgres_configuration_secret` at the CR spec level, or simply be present on the namespace under the name `<resourcename>-postgres-configuration`.


The secret should be formatted as follows:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <resourcename>-postgres-configuration
  namespace: <target namespace>
stringData:
  host: <external ip or url resolvable by the cluster>
  port: <external port, this usually defaults to 5432>
  database: <desired database name>
  username: <username to connect as>
  password: <password to connect with>
  sslmode: prefer
  type: unmanaged
type: Opaque
```

> Please ensure that the value for the variable "password" is wrapped in quotes if the password contains any special characters.

> It is possible to set a specific username, password, port, or database, but still have the database managed by the operator. In this case, when creating the postgres-configuration secret, the `type: managed` field should be added.

**Note**: The variable `sslmode` is valid for `external` databases only. The allowed values are: `prefer`, `disable`, `allow`, `require`, `verify-ca`, `verify-full`.

#### Migrating data from an old AWX instance

For instructions on how to migrate from an older version of AWX, see [migration.md](./docs/migration.md).

#### Managed PostgreSQL Service

If you don't have access to an external PostgreSQL service, the AWX operator can deploy one for you along side the AWX instance itself.

The following variables are customizable for the managed PostgreSQL service

| Name                                 | Description                                | Default                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| postgres_image                       | Path of the image to pull                  | postgres:12                       |
| postgres_resource_requirements       | PostgreSQL container resource requirements | Empty object                      |
| postgres_storage_requirements        | PostgreSQL container storage requirements  | requests: {storage: 8Gi}          |
| postgres_storage_class               | PostgreSQL PV storage class                | Empty string                      |
| postgres_data_path                   | PostgreSQL data path                       | `/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata` |

Example of customization could be:

```yaml
---
spec:
  ...
  postgres_resource_requirements:
    requests:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 2Gi
    limits:
      cpu: 1
      memory: 4Gi
  postgres_storage_requirements:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi
    limits:
      storage: 50Gi
  postgres_storage_class: fast-ssd
```

**Note**: If `postgres_storage_class` is not defined, Postgres will store it's data on a volume using the default storage class for your cluster.

### Advanced Configuration

#### Deploying a specific version of AWX

There are a few variables that are customizable for awx the image management.

| Name                      | Description                |
| --------------------------| -------------------------- |
| image                     | Path of the image to pull  |
| image_version             | Image version to pull      |
| image_pull_policy         | The pull policy to adopt   |
| image_pull_secret         | The pull secret to use     |
| ee_images                 | A list of EEs to register  |
| redis_image               | Path of the image to pull  |
| redis_image_version       | Image version to pull      |

Example of customization could be:

```yaml
---
spec:
  ...
  image: myorg/my-custom-awx
  image_version: latest
  image_pull_policy: Always
  image_pull_secret: pull_secret_name
  ee_images:
    - name: my-custom-awx-ee
      image: myorg/my-custom-awx-ee
```

**Note**: The `image` and `image_version` are intended for local mirroring scenarios. Please note that using a version of AWX other than the one bundled with the `awx-operator` is **not** supported. For the default values, check the [main.yml](https://github.com/ansible/awx-operator/blob/devel/roles/installer/defaults/main.yml) file.

#### Redis container capabilities

Depending on your kubernetes cluster and settings you might need to grant some capabilities to the redis container so it can start. Set the `redis_capabilities` option so the capabilities are added in the deployment.

```yaml
---
spec:
  ...
  redis_capabilities:
    - CHOWN
    - SETUID
    - SETGID
```

#### Privileged Tasks

Depending on the type of tasks that you'll be running, you may find that you need the task pod to run as `privileged`. This can open yourself up to a variety of security concerns, so you should be aware (and verify that you have the privileges) to do this if necessary. In order to toggle this feature, you can add the following to your custom resource:

```yaml
---
spec:
  ...
  task_privileged: true
```

If you are attempting to do this on an OpenShift cluster, you will need to grant the `awx` ServiceAccount the `privileged` SCC, which can be done with:

```
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z awx
```

Again, this is the most relaxed SCC that is provided by OpenShift, so be sure to familiarize yourself with the security concerns that accompany this action.

#### Passing in a runAsUser to task and controller-ee
In cases where the task container contains the projects on the file system and the controller-ee needs to access it, we need a uniform UID in order to avoid permission denied errors. It can be specified with the following variable:

```yaml
---
spec:
  ...
  run_userid: 1000

#### Containers Resource Requirements

The resource requirements for both, the task and the web containers are configurable - both the lower end (requests) and the upper end (limits).

| Name                             | Description                                      | Default                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| web_resource_requirements        | Web container resource requirements              | requests: {cpu: 1000m, memory: 2Gi} |
| task_resource_requirements       | Task container resource requirements             | requests: {cpu: 500m, memory: 1Gi}  |
| ee_resource_requirements         | EE control plane container resource requirements | requests: {cpu: 500m, memory: 1Gi}  |

Example of customization could be:

```yaml
---
spec:
  ...
  web_resource_requirements:
    requests:
      cpu: 1000m
      memory: 2Gi
    limits:
      cpu: 2000m
      memory: 4Gi
  task_resource_requirements:
    requests:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 1Gi
    limits:
      cpu: 1000m
      memory: 2Gi
  ee_resource_requirements:
    requests:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 1Gi
    limits:
      cpu: 1000m
      memory: 2Gi
```

#### Assigning AWX pods to specific nodes

You can constrain the AWX pods created by the operator to run on a certain subset of nodes. `node_selector` and `postgres_selector` constrains
the AWX pods to run only on the nodes that match all the specified key/value pairs. `tolerations` and `postgres_tolerations` allow the AWX
pods to be scheduled onto nodes with matching taints.


| Name                           | Description                 | Default |
| -------------------------------| --------------------------- | ------- |
| postgres_image                 | Path of the image to pull   | 12      |
| postgres_image_version         | Image version to pull       | 12      |
| node_selector                  | AWX pods' nodeSelector      | ''      |
| tolerations                    | AWX pods' tolerations       | ''      |
| postgres_selector              | Postgres pods' nodeSelector | ''      |
| postgres_tolerations           | Postgres pods' tolerations  | ''      |

Example of customization could be:

```yaml
---
spec:
  ...
  node_selector: |
    disktype: ssd
    kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
    kubernetes.io/os: linux
  tolerations: |
    - key: "dedicated"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "AWX"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  postgres_selector: |
    disktype: ssd
    kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
    kubernetes.io/os: linux
  postgres_tolerations: |
    - key: "dedicated"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "AWX"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
```

#### Trusting a Custom Certificate Authority

In cases which you need to trust a custom Certificate Authority, there are few variables you can customize for the `awx-operator`.

Trusting a custom Certificate Authority allows the AWX to access network services configured with SSL certificates issued locally, such as cloning a project from from an internal Git server via HTTPS. It is common for these scenarios, experiencing the error [unable to verify the first certificate](https://github.com/ansible/awx-operator/issues/376).


| Name                             | Description                              | Default |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------|
| ldap_cacert_secret               | LDAP Certificate Authority secret name   |  ''     |
| bundle_cacert_secret             | Certificate Authority secret name        |  ''     |

Please note the `awx-operator` will look for the data field `ldap-ca.crt` in the specified secret when using the `ldap_cacert_secret`, whereas the data field `bundle-ca.crt` is required for `bundle_cacert_secret` parameter.

Example of customization could be:

```yaml
---
spec:
  ...
  ldap_cacert_secret: <resourcename>-custom-certs
  bundle_cacert_secret: <resourcename>-custom-certs
```

To create the secret, you can use the command below:

```
# kubectl create secret generic <resourcename>-custom-certs \
    --from-file=ldap-ca.crt=<PATH/TO/YOUR/CA/PEM/FILE>  \
    --from-file=bundle-ca.crt=<PATH/TO/YOUR/CA/PEM/FILE>
```

#### Persisting Projects Directory

In cases which you want to persist the `/var/lib/projects` directory, there are few variables that are customizable for the `awx-operator`.

| Name                               | Description                                                                                          | Default        |
| -----------------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------|
| projects_persistence         | Whether or not the /var/lib/projects directory will be persistent                                    |  false         |
| projects_storage_class       | Define the PersistentVolume storage class                                                            |  ''            |
| projects_storage_size        | Define the PersistentVolume size                                                                     |  8Gi           |
| projects_storage_access_mode | Define the PersistentVolume access mode                                                              |  ReadWriteMany |
| projects_existing_claim      | Define an existing PersistentVolumeClaim to use (cannot be combined with `projects_storage_*`) |  ''            |

Example of customization when the `awx-operator` automatically handles the persistent volume could be:

```yaml
---
spec:
  ...
  projects_persistence: true
  projects_storage_class: rook-ceph
  projects_storage_size: 20Gi
```

#### Custom Volume and Volume Mount Options

In a scenario where custom volumes and volume mounts are required to either overwrite defaults or mount configuration files.

| Name                              | Description                                              | Default |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| extra_volumes                     | Specify extra volumes to add to the application pod      | ''      |
| web_extra_volume_mounts           | Specify volume mounts to be added to Web container       | ''      |
| task_extra_volume_mounts          | Specify volume mounts to be added to Task container      | ''      |
| ee_extra_volume_mounts            | Specify volume mounts to be added to Execution container | ''      |
| init_container_extra_volume_mounts| Specify volume mounts to be added to Init container      | ''      |
| init_container_extra_commands     | Specify additional commands for Init container           | ''      |


> :warning: The `ee_extra_volume_mounts` and `extra_volumes` will only take effect to the globally available Execution Environments. For custom `ee`, please [customize the Pod spec](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/administration/external_execution_envs.html#customize-the-pod-spec).

Example configuration for ConfigMap

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: <resourcename>-extra-config
  namespace: <target namespace>
data:
  ansible.cfg: |
     [defaults]
     remote_tmp = /tmp
     [ssh_connection]
     ssh_args = -C -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s
  custom.py:  |
      INSIGHTS_URL_BASE = "example.org"
      AWX_CLEANUP_PATHS = True
```
Example spec file for volumes and volume mounts

```yaml
---
    spec:
    ...
      extra_volumes: |
        - name: ansible-cfg
          configMap:
            defaultMode: 420
            items:
              - key: ansible.cfg
                path: ansible.cfg
            name: <resourcename>-extra-config
        - name: custom-py
          configMap:
            defaultMode: 420
            items:
              - key: custom.py
                path: custom.py
            name: <resourcename>-extra-config
        - name: shared-volume
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: my-external-volume-claim

      init_container_extra_volume_mounts: |
        - name: shared-volume
          mountPath: /shared

      init_container_extra_commands: |
        # set proper permissions (rwx) for the awx user
        chmod 775 /shared
        chgrp 1000 /shared

      ee_extra_volume_mounts: |
        - name: ansible-cfg
          mountPath: /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
          subPath: ansible.cfg

      task_extra_volume_mounts: |
        - name: custom-py
          mountPath: /etc/tower/conf.d/custom.py
          subPath: custom.py
        - name: shared-volume
          mountPath: /shared
```

> :warning: **Volume and VolumeMount names cannot contain underscores(_)**

#### Default execution environments from private registries

In order to register default execution environments from private registries, the Custom Resource needs to know about the pull credentials. Those credentials should be stored as a secret and either specified as `ee_pull_credentials_secret` at the CR spec level, or simply be present on the namespace under the name `<resourcename>-ee-pull-credentials` . Instance initialization will register a `Container registry` type credential on the deployed instance and assign it to the registered default execution environments.

The secret should be formated as follows:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <resourcename>-ee-pull-credentials
  namespace: <target namespace>
stringData:
  url: <registry url. i.e. quay.io>
  username: <username to connect as>
  password: <password to connect with>
  ssl_verify: <Optional attribute. Whether verify ssl connection or not. Accepted values "True" (default), "False" >
type: Opaque
```

##### Control plane ee from private registry
The images listed in "ee_images" will be added as globally available Execution Environments. The "control_plane_ee_image" will be used to run project updates. In order to use a private image for any of these you'll need to use `image_pull_secret` to provide a k8s pull secret to access it. Currently the same secret is used for any of these images supplied at install time.

You can create `image_pull_secret`
```
kubectl create secret <resoucename>-cp-pull-credentials regcred --docker-server=<your-registry-server> --docker-username=<your-name> --docker-password=<your-pword> --docker-email=<your-email>
```
If you need more control (for example, to set a namespace or a label on the new secret) then you can customise the Secret before storing it

Example spec file extra-config

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <resoucename>-cp-pull-credentials
  namespace: <target namespace>
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: <base64 docker config>
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```

#### Exporting Environment Variables to Containers

If you need to export custom environment variables to your containers.

| Name                          | Description                                              | Default |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| task_extra_env                | Environment variables to be added to Task container      | ''      |
| web_extra_env                 | Environment variables to be added to Web container       | ''      |
| ee_extra_env                  | Environment variables to be added to EE container        | ''      |

> :warning: The `ee_extra_env` will only take effect to the globally available Execution Environments. For custom `ee`, please [customize the Pod spec](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/administration/external_execution_envs.html#customize-the-pod-spec).

Example configuration of environment variables

```yaml
  spec:
    task_extra_env: |
      - name: MYCUSTOMVAR
        value: foo
    web_extra_env: |
      - name: MYCUSTOMVAR
        value: foo
    ee_extra_env: |
      - name: MYCUSTOMVAR
        value: foo
```

#### Extra Settings

With`extra_settings`, you can pass multiple custom settings via the `awx-operator`. The parameter `extra_settings`  will be appended to the `/etc/tower/settings.py` and can be an alternative to the `extra_volumes` parameter.

| Name                          | Description                                              | Default |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| extra_settings                | Extra settings                                           | ''      |

Example configuration of `extra_settings` parameter

```yaml
  spec:
    extra_settings:
      - setting: MAX_PAGE_SIZE
        value: "500"

      - setting: AUTH_LDAP_BIND_DN
        value: "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com"
```

#### Service Account

If you need to modify some `ServiceAccount` proprieties

| Name                          | Description                                              | Default |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| service_account_annotations   | Annotations to the ServiceAccount                        | ''      |

Example configuration of environment variables

```yaml
  spec:
    service_account_annotations: |
      eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/<IAM_ROLE_NAME>
```


### Uninstall ###

To uninstall an AWX deployment instance, you basically need to remove the AWX kind related to that instance. For example, to delete an AWX instance named awx-demo, you would do:

```
$ kubectl delete awx awx-demo
awx.awx.ansible.com "awx-demo" deleted
```

Deleting an AWX instance will remove all related deployments and statefulsets, however, persistent volumes and secrets will remain. To enforce secrets also getting removed, you can use `garbage_collect_secrets: true`.

### Upgrading

To upgrade AWX, it is recommended to upgrade the awx-operator to the version that maps to the desired version of AWX.  To find the version of AWX that will be installed by the awx-operator by default, check the version specified in the `image_version` variable in `roles/installer/defaults/main.yml` for that particular release.

Apply the awx-operator.yml for that release to upgrade the operator, and in turn also upgrade your AWX deployment.

#### v0.14.0

##### Cluster-scope to Namespace-scope considerations

Starting with awx-operator 0.14.0, AWX can only be deployed in the namespace that the operator exists in. This is called a namespace-scoped operator. If you are upgrading from an earlier version, you will want to
delete your existing `awx-operator` service account, role and role binding.

##### Project is now based on v1.x of the operator-sdk project

Starting with awx-operator 0.14.0, the project is now based on operator-sdk 1.x. You may need to manually delete your old operator Deployment to avoid issues.

## Contributing

Please visit [our contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ansible/awx-operator/blob/devel/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Release Process

### Update version and files

Update the awx-operator version:

  - `Makefile`

### Verify Functionality

Run the following command inside this directory:

```
$ IMAGE_TAG_BASE=quay.io/<user>/awx-operator make docker-build docker-push
```

After it is built, test it on a local cluster:

```
$ minikube start --memory 6g --cpus 4
$ minikube addons enable ingress
$ export NAMESPACE=example-awx
$ make deploy
$ ansible-playbook ansible/instantiate-awx-deployment.yml -e namespace=$NAMESPACE -e image=quay.io/<user>/awx -e service_type=nodeport
$ # Verify that the awx-task and awx-web containers are launched
$ # with the right version of the awx image
$ # Launch a job at `minikube service awx-demo-service --url -n $NAMESPACE`
$ minikube delete
```

### Update changelog

Generate a list of commits between the versions and add it to the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).
```
$ git log --no-merges --pretty="- %s (%an) - %h " <old_tag>..<new_tag>
```

### Commit / Create Release

If everything works, commit the updated version, then [publish a new release](https://github.com/ansible/awx-operator/releases/new) using the same version you used in `ansible/group_vars/all`.

After creating the release, [this GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/ansible/awx-operator/blob/devel/.github/workflows/release.yaml) will run and publish the new image to quay.io.
