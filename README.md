# AWX Operator Documentation

The AWX Operator documentation is now available at https://awx-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

For docs changes, create PRs on the appropriate files in the /docs folder.

## Contributing

Please visit [our contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ansible/awx-operator/blob/devel/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Release Process

The first step is to create a draft release. Typically this will happen in the [Stage Release](https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/devel/.github/workflows/stage.yml) workflow for AWX and you don't need to do it as a separate step.

If you need to do an independent release of the operator, you can run the [Stage Release](https://github.com/ansible/awx-operator/blob/devel/.github/workflows/stage.yml) in the awx-operator repo. Both of these workflows will run smoke tests, so there is no need to do this manually.

After the draft release is created, publish it and the [Promote AWX Operator image](https://github.com/ansible/awx-operator/blob/devel/.github/workflows/promote.yaml) will run, which will:

- Publish image to Quay
- Release Helm chart

## Author
