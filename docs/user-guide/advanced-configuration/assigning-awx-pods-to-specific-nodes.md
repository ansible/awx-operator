#### Assigning AWX pods to specific nodes

You can constrain the AWX pods created by the operator to run on a certain subset of nodes. `node_selector` and `postgres_selector` constrains
the AWX pods to run only on the nodes that match all the specified key/value pairs. `tolerations` and `postgres_tolerations` allow the AWX
pods to be scheduled onto nodes with matching taints.
The ability to specify topologySpreadConstraints is also allowed through `topology_spread_constraints`
If you want to use affinity rules for your AWX pod you can use the `affinity` option.

If you want to constrain the web and task pods individually, you can do so by specificying the deployment type before the specific setting. For
example, specifying `task_tolerations` will allow the AWX task pod to be scheduled onto nodes with matching taints.
